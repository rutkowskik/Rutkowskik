# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I'm a passionate Java developer currently working as a back-end developer at Kamsoft S.A. in Gliwice. My expertise lies in creating robust applications using Java, with a focus on frameworks such as Spring and Struts. I have strong skills in SQL and experience working with DB2 and Oracle databases, making me proficient in handling large-scale data operations.
One of the highlights of my GitHub is Zak≈ÇadyApp, my first recruitment project and a key milestone in my career. I'm continuously advancing my skills in web technologies and aiming to become a full stack developer. I am a fast learner who thrives on challenges and is always eager to expand my professional capabilities.
